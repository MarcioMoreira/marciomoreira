      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Márcio Moreira</strong>, a Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong
        foundation in <strong>Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong> and modern development
        practices. I recently completed the <strong>Code for All_ Full Stack Bootcamp</strong>,
        where I built several projects focused on clean architecture, teamwork and problem solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background combines technical skills with a strong sense of responsibility,
        adaptability and communication. During the bootcamp, I worked in
        <strong>agile, team-based environments</strong>, developing applications using
        <strong>MVC principles</strong>, object-oriented programming and RESTful logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy transforming ideas into functional, user-focused applications and I’m
        particularly interested in <strong>web development, data-driven solutions and cloud-based
        technologies</strong>. I value clean code, continuous learning and building solutions
        that are both scalable and maintainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my frontend skills, improving my understanding
        of backend systems and preparing to contribute to real-world projects where I can grow
        as a developer and add value to a team.
